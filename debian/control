Description: Framework for Securing Software Update Systems
 Like the S in HTTPS, a plug-and-play library for securing a software updater
 .
 The Update Framework (TUF) helps developers secure their new or existing
 software update systems. Software update systems are vulnerable to many
 known attacks, including those that can result in clients being compromised
 or crashed. TUF helps solve this problem by providing a flexible security
 framework that can be added to software updaters.
